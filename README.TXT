This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms.
That's all.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

This project was written as the starting point of a small Java project.

The goal is to extend the game:

  - add items to rooms (items may have weight)
  - add multiple players
  - add commands (pick, drop, examine, read, ...)
  - (anything you can think of, really...)

Read chapter 7 of the book to get a detailed description of the project.
